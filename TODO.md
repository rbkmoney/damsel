# Payments

 * What to do with terminal descriptors?

    They seemed out of place, therefore been removed for the moment. We need to encompass too much in a single abstraction, looks like we need dynamic schemas for this kind of thing.

 * Way to specify terminal attributes (more generally, attributes of technical interaction) for a specific merchant.

 * Some proxies need to know provider profit / compensation.

    Expose cash flow?

# Proxies

 * In order to acquire foreign customers we need to store a _billing address_.

    Maybe a good fit for a payment session?
